## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Task (1 hour):
Create a React.js application that displays completed statemindâ€™s audits.

You can get required data with the next url: https://statemind.io/projects.json.

The app should include three pages:
- a clients list (/)
- a client's project list (/[client])
- markdown feedback form with live preview (/[client]/project).

You can use any libraries, including next.js or other frameworks.

Provide a visually appealing design with a notification for successful feedback submission (do not perform any network requests, just simulate it). Assessment will consider functionality, code quality, React skills, design, and user interface clarity.

The developer has a set timeframe to complete the task, with a requirement to submit the source code and provide explanations.
